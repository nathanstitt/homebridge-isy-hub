Renamed and additional device support by Nathan Stitt

This is basically a fork of homebridge-isy-js as implemented by Rod Toll and pradeepmouli
with added support for a few devices that I needed, namely the 2475 InLineLink Dimmer.

I renamed the project to homebridge-isy-hub so I could publish to NPM for easily deployment
to my network

Please see https://github.com/pradeepmouli/homebridge-isy-js for a better supported version, but
don't hestitate to extract any of my code that you find useful
